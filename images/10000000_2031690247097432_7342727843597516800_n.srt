1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:01,689
This season on "The Flash...

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,686
DeVoe and his wife are super villains.

3
00:00:03,687 --> 00:00:05,255
He created 12 meta-humans

4
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:06,689
just so he could steal their powers.

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,075
This was your team member, Ralph Dibny.

6
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,093
A rookie hero.

7
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:11,528
I'll save you!

8
00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,290
My husband is dead. I'm
leaving you, Clifford.

9
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:16,670
This is an intelligence booster.

10
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:17,930
Your mind is being rebooted.

11
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,615
The more I try to use my brains,

12
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:20,995
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

13
00:00:20,996 --> 00:00:24,307
DeVoe plans to position each of his
five satellites around the globe.

14
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:26,548
Satellites working together
for a single purpose?

15
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:29,199
DeVoe wants to remove the
intelligence of everyone on earth.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,760
Let there be light.

17
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:38,947
Hey, it's Barry. Leave a message.

18
00:00:38,948 --> 00:00:41,115
Allen, Captain Singh.

19
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,584
Got some good news about
you getting your job back.

20
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,487
You can thank your wife, too.

21
00:00:45,488 --> 00:00:47,555
Apparently the Mayor read
all those posts Iris wrote

22
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:49,057
about DeVoe, and she's decided...

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

24
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:45,180
- Cisco, we need power!
- Working on it!

25
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,349
Nothing is working.
Not even cell phones.

26
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,449
That's what I was worried about.

27
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,884
It's happening isn't it?

28
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:51,286
I don't know. I mean,
our plan didn't work.

29
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:52,787
DeVoe replaced the satellite I destroyed

30
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:55,094
with the S.T.A.R. Labs Satellite
to set off The Enlightenment.

31
00:01:55,095 --> 00:01:56,889
Bar, it's going nuts out there.

32
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,592
There is no power anywhere.
Our car just stopped working.

33
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,262
Thank God we were close by.

34
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:01,419
I mean, the hospital is
another three miles away.

35
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,638
The hospital?

36
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,666
- Joe?
- The sky turned purple,

37
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,702
and she started having contractions

38
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:08,635
Cisco, hurry!

39
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:10,638
If we're not able to get her
to the hospital can you use...

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,006
No, Barry can't run her.

41
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,441
It is not safe for Cecile or the baby.

42
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,076
Then what are we gonna do?

43
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:16,444
I have everything here I'd
need to deliver a baby.

44
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:17,511
- Huh?
- What?

45
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,980
- Thank God.
- Great.

46
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,782
Let's go see how dilated you are.

47
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:23,151
- Okay.
- Breathe, baby, breathe.

48
00:02:23,152 --> 00:02:24,518
Hey.

49
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:26,889
You're gonna want to see this.

50
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,844
DeVoe must to predicted
Harry would build

51
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,139
his own thinking cap and power it

52
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,622
with the dark matter from this tube.

53
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:36,537
Dark matter that he
could then siphon off

54
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,313
from S.T.A.R. Labs to use
to infect the world.

55
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:40,923
Harry was his guinea pig.
He knew if he could reboot.

56
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:42,733
Harry's brain, he could
reboot everyone's.

57
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:45,277
What about Gideon, could she
hack into the satellites?

58
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:47,387
No, purple haze took her out too.

59
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:49,840
So, what do we do?

60
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:54,237
I don't know.

61
00:02:54,246 --> 00:02:57,257
It's okay, Barry.

62
00:02:57,266 --> 00:02:58,825
I think I do.

63
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:08,062
Look, I love "Inception"
as much as the next guy,

64
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,698
but sending Barry into DeVoe's mind?

65
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,467
His mind is the only one fast enough

66
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,936
to survive the linking
process without any harm.

67
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:16,504
Yeah, but how would this
help us to stop him?

68
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:18,406
If we can find the good left in Clifford

69
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,341
and help it retake control of his mind,

70
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:21,977
that good could overpower the bad.

71
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:24,412
You think there actually
is good left inside him?

72
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,614
I know that this is hard to imagine,

73
00:03:26,615 --> 00:03:28,582
but there was a time when
Clifford was nothing but good,

74
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,551
when he truly wanted to help the world.

75
00:03:30,552 --> 00:03:32,587
It's the dark matter he infused
in his brain that changed him.

76
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,756
So yes, I do believe that
there is some good in him.

77
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,391
Someway we just need to find it.

78
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:37,959
This is crazy.

79
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,427
I mean, why don't we just
call someone we trust?

80
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,862
Kara, Oliver, Wally...

81
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,563
You could bring a
legion of your friends,

82
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:44,766
but they would pose no challenge.

83
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,935
Clifford created the bus
metas and the combination

84
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,503
of the abilities to ensure
that he could defeat anyone

85
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,574
whose assistance you might enlist.

86
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,456
How long until our minds are wiped?

87
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,249
We have until the
permeation grid hits 100%.

88
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,211
How would we get me inside his mind?

89
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,888
We need to find a way to transfer
your consciousness into his.

90
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:10,151
No, you know what happens
every time I try to vibe him.

91
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,697
I can't do it.

92
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:13,170
I do.

93
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:16,248
But I don't think it's your
power we need, Mr. Ramon.

94
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,347
I believe it's hers.

95
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:29,077
This will amplify Ms.
Horton's telepathic ability

96
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,379
to link The Flash's
consciousness to Clifford's,

97
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,980
wherever he may be.

98
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,049
It could also provide a
one-way link so that

99
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,085
he doesn't realize that
someone is inside his mind.

100
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:41,555
So it's kind like a one-way brain radio.

101
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:43,024
I suppose so, yes.

102
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,646
Hey, hear that, Harry?

103
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,963
That cerebral inhibitor of yours
is going to be put to good use.

104
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,428
I'm sorry about your friend.
His mind could...

105
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:55,907
Sorry won't make him better. Will it?

106
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,577
- Everything ready?
- Think so.

107
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,211
Mr. Allen, the chair.

108
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,155
Ms. Horton, the gurney.

109
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,416
You want to put him in that thing?

110
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,518
It is the only way to
establish a transcranial link

111
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,065
between Ms. Horton and Mr. Allen.

112
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,408
Joe, I'll be all right.

113
00:05:15,057 --> 00:05:16,758
I'll be here the whole time.

114
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,961
We know.

115
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:28,917
Mr. Allen, put the cap on your head.

116
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,399
Once Cecile has locked on
to DeVoe's brain waves,

117
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:35,510
we'll transfer your
consciousness to his amygdala.

118
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:37,011
That's the part of the
brain that connects

119
00:05:37,012 --> 00:05:38,579
emotional significance to memories.

120
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,180
Where the good memories are,

121
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,584
we will find the good part of Clifford.

122
00:05:44,452 --> 00:05:46,788
Here we go, Ms. Horton...

123
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,253
Barry?

124
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:14,651
Barry?

125
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,768
Is everything okay?

126
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,365
You've gotta be kidding me.

127
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:34,988
Guys, I'm in.

128
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:36,817
Paint the picture. What do
you see? What's around you?

129
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:39,064
For starters, The Thinker.

130
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,222
I'm in the 405 bus, in the
middle of the street.

131
00:06:41,223 --> 00:06:43,964
I just came out of that
same portal from before.

132
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,767
This is where it all began.

133
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:47,802
It is the nexus of Clifford's brain.

134
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:49,671
Once you find him, get him through it,

135
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:51,472
and he can regain control of his mind.

136
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,508
Okay, what does he need to look for?

137
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:54,776
Our house.

138
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,813
All right.

139
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,465
Barry, what do you see?

140
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,867
Nothing.

141
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,635
A little vague for the viewers at home.

142
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,003
What do you mean "nothing"?

143
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:24,674
I mean it's empty.

144
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,178
It is completely empty.

145
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,214
All right, well, where should I go...

146
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:34,082
Barry? Barry, can you hear me?

147
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,751
Babe, breathe.

148
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,853
Cecile's powers are
connected to her pregnancy.

149
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:41,469
Her contractions must be putting
a strain on her transcranial link.

150
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,391
No, no, no. We need to do
something about that.

151
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,660
But we can't stop her from
having a baby, Marlize.

152
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:48,463
We have to, Mrs. West-Allen,
or this will never work.

153
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:49,998
She is the only way to get Barry

154
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:51,348
in and out of Clifford's mind.

155
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,211
Everyone chill;

156
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:55,737
It's not like Cecile is going to lose
her powers if she has this baby.

157
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:58,206
Cecile is going to lose her
powers if she has this baby?

158
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,410
Won't that leave Barry
stranded in DeVoe's mind?

159
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:02,410
I'm afraid so.

160
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,778
Information you may
have wanted to share,

161
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,614
like, way before now.

162
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,615
Joe, do you still have
that inhaler I gave you?

163
00:08:07,616 --> 00:08:09,852
Yeah, it's in our hospital bag.

164
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,753
Okay, most inhalers contain
the drug terbutaline,

165
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,491
which can be used to
slow down contractions.

166
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,997
I found Thomas.

167
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:21,669
He's been this way all the time.

168
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:25,166
What the hell is all about?

169
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,136
I... I don't know... I'm
going to get the inhaler.

170
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,739
- Cisco, cover me.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,732
Guys, we need to tell
Barry where to go next.

172
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:35,306
And fast. Harry figured
out where Marlize was.

173
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,080
Maybe he can...

174
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,703
Harry?

175
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,236
What are you doing?

176
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:49,177
Help.

177
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:52,562
No.

178
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,697
You are not frying away
what's left of you.

179
00:08:55,698 --> 00:08:56,578
Help!

180
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:57,867
Help.

181
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:00,961
Please.

182
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,805
See?

183
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:38,484
Nothing.

184
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:40,750
Ramon.

185
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,284
Where DeVoe first fell
in love with Marlize.

186
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,520
Tell Barry to go there.

187
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,648
You'll find him there.

188
00:09:58,995 --> 00:10:00,547
Okay?

189
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,453
Okay.

190
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,368
And one more thing.

191
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,125
Stars, so little.

192
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:35,697
We shouldn't be here.

193
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,770
I won't lose anyone else today.

194
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,070
I won't.

195
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:53,080
Harry had an idea. Go to Oxford.

196
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,181
Oxford?

197
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:55,950
The Hamlet of Boars Hill.

198
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:58,172
The place where we fell in love.

199
00:10:58,181 --> 00:11:00,216
All right, I'm on my way.

200
00:11:05,728 --> 00:11:07,095
I'm here.

201
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:11,039
There is a blanket, some wine...

202
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,786
There's a song playing on a car radio.

203
00:11:15,934 --> 00:11:17,306
Our first dance.

204
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:18,748
And DeVoe?

205
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:20,921
He's not here.

206
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:23,928
All right guys, well...

207
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:25,789
where to next?

208
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,053
Rookie?

209
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,284
Allen? What are you doing here?

210
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:44,263
Ralph? Is that really you?

211
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:47,328
I thought I lost you.

212
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:50,780
I'm so sorry, man. I...

213
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,492
I missed you too, Barry.

214
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,566
Barry, did you just say, Ralph?

215
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:56,143
Yes, guys. Yeah, it's Ralph.

216
00:11:56,152 --> 00:11:58,955
He's... he's alive.

217
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:04,863
Wait, how are you even here?

218
00:12:04,864 --> 00:12:06,367
How are you here?

219
00:12:07,834 --> 00:12:09,835
Did DeVoe... did he get you?

220
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,237
No, no, he didn't.

221
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:13,739
He... Cecile is using her telepathy

222
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,475
to get my consciousness
inside DeVoe's mind.

223
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,690
That's trippy.

224
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,245
Why?

225
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:22,181
We need to find the good part of him

226
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,850
so we can stop the bad from
starting the Enlightenment.

227
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:26,362
Have you seen him?

228
00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:28,511
A good DeVoe?

229
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,377
No.

230
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,118
Just the evil, floating chair variety.

231
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,629
He visits me all the time.

232
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,317
He knows you're here?

233
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,267
Why would he need to...

234
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:44,736
In this place I do as I please, Mr.
Allen.

235
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,772
I must say, the fact that you thought

236
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:48,774
I wouldn't have calculated
you and your team making

237
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:52,044
this feeble attempt is
somewhat insulting.

238
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:55,848
There will be not defeating the
big bad this year, Mr. Allen.

239
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:58,497
See, you are in my mind now.

240
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,660
And there's no escape.

241
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:09,603
Run, Mr. Allen, run.

242
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:13,810
Barry?

243
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:15,834
Barry!

244
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:18,365
He's... he's coming for us.

245
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,305
He's coming for us.
I heard his thoughts.

246
00:13:20,306 --> 00:13:22,274
He's coming. He's coming... here.

247
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,878
- We need to leave.
- And go where?

248
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,848
Okay, what do we doing?

249
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,216
I'm getting you out of here.

250
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:32,818
We still need to find
the good DeVoe, though.

251
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,486
How?

252
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,721
He's gonna be someplace that
means something to him.

253
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:40,060
Before he became who he is now.

254
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:46,433
You mean like when he was a
simple history professor?

255
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,704
Stars are raining.

256
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,207
Got to go! Come on.

257
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,935
Good.

258
00:13:59,846 --> 00:14:03,958
We are gathered here today
to worship in song.

259
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:07,630
I suggest "Kumbaya."

260
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,716
A force field.

261
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:13,125
Force field, sucker.

262
00:14:13,126 --> 00:14:15,828
I should never have let
you build this chair

263
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:17,430
without my oversight.

264
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:20,265
It was my first miscalculation.

265
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,567
You've made many miscalculations.

266
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:24,202
Really?

267
00:14:24,203 --> 00:14:26,972
Have you ever pondered why
I never pursued The Flash?

268
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:30,224
Never needed his speed or his mind?

269
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,511
Anyone?

270
00:14:32,512 --> 00:14:34,346
His connection to the Speed Force.

271
00:14:34,347 --> 00:14:38,617
Access to all of time...
past, present, future.

272
00:14:38,618 --> 00:14:40,252
True knowledge.

273
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:44,198
And now that you have
placed him inside my mind,

274
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:47,276
I'll have it all.

275
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,530
You'll have to find us first.

276
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,016
DeVoe's lair? Are you crazy?

277
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:04,726
Can he find us in this pocket dimension?

278
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:06,237
I've bought us some time.

279
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,383
Time... rhyme... fly... side.

280
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:13,486
Cecile, we need you to try and
link up with Barry again.

281
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,081
I'll try.

282
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,212
Professor DeVoe?

283
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:31,736
Barry?

284
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:33,138
Barry, can you hear me?

285
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:35,251
Yeah. Yeah, Iris, I hear you.

286
00:15:36,056 --> 00:15:37,275
What's wrong?

287
00:15:37,276 --> 00:15:38,611
Good DeVoe, we found him.

288
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,404
He's dead.

289
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,738
I don't suppose you have
another plan, do you?

290
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,215
No, man. I mean, I... this was it.

291
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:01,742
Now...

292
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:04,332
Now the world belongs to the Thinker.

293
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,113
Allen, listen to me.

294
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm stuck here,

295
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,057
but you're not.

296
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,548
You should go.

297
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,765
Be with your family for
whatever time is left.

298
00:16:17,774 --> 00:16:18,973
No.

299
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,689
No.

300
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:23,205
Okay, first of all, it's our family,

301
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:25,270
and I'm not leaving you behind.

302
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,405
There's gotta be another way.

303
00:16:27,656 --> 00:16:29,390
Allen, you said the only
way to save the world

304
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,035
is by finding the good
that's left in DeVoe.

305
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,246
It's right here.

306
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:37,094
With a hole in its chest.

307
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,648
It's not the only good left in him.

308
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,008
Why the brakes? Are we there?

309
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,356
Almost.

310
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,450
So that's the Hellmouth?

311
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:57,652
That's the nexus of DeVoe's mind.

312
00:16:57,653 --> 00:16:59,453
Marlize said we can take control of him

313
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:01,055
if the good in DeVoe passes through it.

314
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:04,025
Allen, we know that's
not possible anymore.

315
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,160
Why do you think he's keeping you alive?

316
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,862
I couldn't figure it
out, but think about it.

317
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:10,398
If you get out, you take
back control of this body,

318
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,799
because it's yours.

319
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,734
That's why he won't let you leave.

320
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:17,004
Once you get out, DeVoe
will cease to exist.

321
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:19,340
All you have to do is make
it through that portal,

322
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:20,742
and you'll regain control.

323
00:17:20,743 --> 00:17:22,176
Remember who you are, Ralph.

324
00:17:22,177 --> 00:17:24,246
A hero.

325
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,824
Let's go get control.

326
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:39,408
Or how about I kill you?

327
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:43,236
A second time if necessary.

328
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,773
What was that?

329
00:17:52,774 --> 00:17:54,252
My husband.

330
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:56,405
He's getting close.

331
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:06,086
Please tell me someone else felt that.

332
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,388
Apologies.

333
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:08,789
I had to force an emergency shift

334
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,058
to another pocket dimension.

335
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,459
It can be unnerving.

336
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,294
Nerving, serving, swerving, curving.

337
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:14,795
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

338
00:18:15,682 --> 00:18:16,430
What's wrong?

339
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:19,867
No more labor suppression.
How you feeling, Cecile?

340
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:22,503
Like... like I don't
know if I can do this.

341
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:24,772
You shouldn't have to. You
should be able to have

342
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,107
our baby just like any other parent,

343
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:27,708
in a hospital, in a regular bed,

344
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,011
not with all this.

345
00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:33,302
Hey, look what you've done
to our friend, my son,

346
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,583
my daughter, the love of my life,

347
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,452
everybody in this damn city.

348
00:18:37,453 --> 00:18:37,892
Dad...

349
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:41,789
How could you ever think that this
would be better for humanity?

350
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,493
Dad, what did you say to me when
Barry came out of the Speed Force?

351
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:48,607
You said, "Strength without
faith means nothing."

352
00:18:48,616 --> 00:18:53,005
We need to have faith that we
can get through this together.

353
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:03,811
How long until he finds us?

354
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,025
Minutes, maybe less.

355
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:31,405
Crap in a hat. I can't hit him.

356
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:32,806
They can read our minds.

357
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:34,241
Then we do this Dibny-style.

358
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:36,210
- What?
- We don't think.

359
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:39,147
Just fill your mind with something else.

360
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,781
Something you love.

361
00:19:40,782 --> 00:19:41,782
Ralph.

362
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,959
Shrimp buffet!

363
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:59,500
It's you and me, Iris.

364
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:13,080
Shrimp platter! Shrimp cocktail!

365
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,451
Beignets de crevettes.

366
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:22,790
Once again, Mr. Allen,

367
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,574
your best will not be good enough.

368
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,593
What's the plan, Rookie?

369
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:29,154
I'm running out of shrimp entrees.

370
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:30,844
You're only gonna need one.

371
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:38,639
They're coming every five minutes.

372
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,841
The stars are raining...

373
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,411
Cecile, please just focus
on not having a baby.

374
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:45,613
Stars are raining, draining, painting.

375
00:20:45,614 --> 00:20:47,214
He sounds just like Barry

376
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,416
when he came out of the Speed Force.

377
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,017
Yeah, I know.

378
00:20:50,018 --> 00:20:52,688
No, I mean, he's saying
the exact same words.

379
00:21:16,545 --> 00:21:19,080
You should mind where
you point your weapon,

380
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:20,730
Detective West.

381
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,833
Stay away from my girls.

382
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,780
Joe!

383
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,125
Hey, attack of the clones,

384
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,293
come and get me.

385
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:20,175
Hang on!

386
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:32,921
That was awesome.

387
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:40,129
Come on.

388
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,816
Now it ends.

389
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:18,994
How did you beat me?!

390
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:23,097
I didn't. We did.

391
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,402
Their emotional attachment to
Mr. Dibny have made them

392
00:24:28,403 --> 00:24:31,605
stronger than you would
ever be, Clifford.

393
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,107
But then, you wouldn't understand.

394
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,314
No! This is not my will!

395
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,540
Not anymore. It's mine.

396
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:01,977
Numbers are still rising.

397
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,498
Clifford's meta-abilities

398
00:25:03,507 --> 00:25:05,942
are no longer controlling
each satellite.

399
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,920
If I can just override
their last command.

400
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,335
Come on.

401
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:52,553
There's no more dark energy
anywhere in the city.

402
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:53,855
We did it.

403
00:25:57,737 --> 00:25:59,638
Oh, my stretchy so-and-so.

404
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,598
Guys...

405
00:26:03,447 --> 00:26:04,752
my water just broke.

406
00:26:04,761 --> 00:26:06,496
Let's get her to the Med Lab. Quickly.

407
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:08,106
- Okay.
- Baby's coming.

408
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,150
- Oh, boy, baby's coming.
- Careful. Carefully.

409
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,177
Come on, Harry.

410
00:26:31,775 --> 00:26:33,478
Please, tell me you've done this before.

411
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:35,403
A few times.

412
00:26:35,655 --> 00:26:36,742
In med school.

413
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:37,449
Med...

414
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:39,532
- Med school?
- Yeah.

415
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:41,876
Okay. Okay. Med school. Okay.

416
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:43,978
Joe, just relax.

417
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:45,880
We got this. Right?

418
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,598
Yeah, just breath out.

419
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,621
Just breath out.

420
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,793
Power's back on everywhere.

421
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,070
Now the world can finally
get back to normal.

422
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,145
Standing, tossing, turning,
falling, falling...

423
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,390
What happened to him?

424
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,367
He is enlightened.

425
00:27:10,924 --> 00:27:13,825
Another use of Mr. Deacon's powers.

426
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:16,102
Technological reincarnation.

427
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,445
Cisco.

428
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:19,160
He's taking over.

429
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,917
I told you that The Enlightenment

430
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:25,953
will come for you, Marlize, and it will.

431
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:29,094
Remember, I thought of everything.

432
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:32,526
Even this moment.

433
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:37,759
Good-bye, my love.

434
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:52,242
We're back online.

435
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,578
Not just that.

436
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:56,702
Satellite's in a decaying orbit.

437
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:06,594
Wait, so Marlize deactivating him
triggered a literal dead man's switch?

438
00:28:06,595 --> 00:28:07,473
It's falling fast.

439
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:09,747
Clifford must've increased
its mass by a thousand-fold.

440
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:11,511
Barry, the impact of something
that heavy and that fast...

441
00:28:11,512 --> 00:28:12,767
- I know.
- How much time do we have?

442
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:13,497
Three minutes if we are lucky.

443
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:16,741
Okay, how do we stop something it is
going to send us back into the stone age?

444
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:19,006
Together. I'll spread the
word to evacuate downtown.

445
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,108
Ralph, Cisco, you guys
clear the impact zone.

446
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:23,512
Barry, you've gotta
destroy that satellite.

447
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,184
Okay, now it's time for you to push.

448
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:31,352
On three.

449
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:34,630
One, two, three.

450
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:37,860
You're doing great.

451
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,967
Go that way! Ma'am, not this way.

452
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:48,069
Take cover.

453
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,442
- Whoa, what is he doing?
- He's building up speed.

454
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:30,211
He's gonna use a sonic
punch to destroy it.

455
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:32,447
Given the satellite's mass
and its escalating descent,

456
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:34,716
what prevents it from destroying him?

457
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:48,963
You're doing great. Now, I
need one big push, okay?

458
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:52,468
One, two, three.

459
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,705
Here she comes.

460
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,225
Yeah!

461
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,212
Barry.

462
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,115
Oh, my gosh.

463
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:07,902
Oh, my God.

464
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:29,616
This will restore your friend's mind.

465
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:33,147
Thank you.

466
00:32:33,156 --> 00:32:35,392
I have a lot to make amends for.

467
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,530
You know, Marlize,

468
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:42,708
there are still a lot
of metas out there.

469
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,288
I mean, we...

470
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:47,348
We could use your help.

471
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,925
You have all the support you need.

472
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,202
There are those, however,
that do need my help.

473
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:57,615
Before I joined my late
husband's crusade,

474
00:32:57,624 --> 00:32:59,692
I used technology to
better the lives of those

475
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:01,132
who had nothing.

476
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:05,145
Back then my mechanical
creations healed the world,

477
00:33:05,154 --> 00:33:08,690
not harmed it.

478
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll just pick up where I left off.

479
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:13,043
Well, good luck.

480
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,187
Thank you.

481
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,796
- Good luck.
- Bye.

482
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:30,996
She risked everything
to try and save him.

483
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,972
She really loved him.

484
00:33:34,772 --> 00:33:37,285
Part of her always will.

485
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:44,624
What... what is it?

486
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:47,460
The last satellite,

487
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,739
it wasn't just me who took it down.

488
00:33:49,748 --> 00:33:51,382
There was someone else.

489
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,443
Who? Who was it?

490
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:56,054
Another speedster.

491
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:02,635
Hang on, Harry. We're almost there.

492
00:34:02,644 --> 00:34:04,880
Okay. Now put this on.

493
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:29,496
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

494
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:31,631
- Is he okay?
- His vitals are stable.

495
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:34,367
The program completed.
It should have worked.

496
00:34:34,867 --> 00:34:36,167
Hey, Harry.

497
00:34:36,301 --> 00:34:38,671
Hey. Harry.

498
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:42,977
Harry?

499
00:34:48,702 --> 00:34:50,537
Don't worry.

500
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:54,567
You have been and will always be...

501
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:57,716
my friend.

502
00:34:59,094 --> 00:35:00,696
Khan.

503
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:07,482
- Kill them.
- Kill them.

504
00:35:13,674 --> 00:35:14,874
Oh, my God.

505
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,291
"Star Wars."

506
00:35:17,522 --> 00:35:19,022
I can't believe it.

507
00:35:19,031 --> 00:35:21,034
Oh, I can't believe it.

508
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:23,745
It's not every day you translate symbols

509
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,776
into binary programming polynomials.

510
00:35:30,016 --> 00:35:32,050
I... I don't know what that means.

511
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,484
Yes, you do.

512
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:36,395
Actually, I don't. I don't
know what that means.

513
00:35:36,404 --> 00:35:40,065
I think some short circuit's
been fried up here,

514
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:42,815
but it's fine.

515
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:44,838
What are you talking about?

516
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,339
I mean, I just don't understand the...

517
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,673
the pol... the thing you said.

518
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:49,284
It's okay though.

519
00:35:53,814 --> 00:35:55,081
What's the matter?

520
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:56,982
Marlize said this would work.

521
00:35:56,983 --> 00:35:58,258
It did work.

522
00:35:58,478 --> 00:35:59,680
Ramon,

523
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:02,351
 you did it.

524
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,747
I'm back, I'm here.

525
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:06,690
I mean, maybe I'm a little more average

526
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,987
than I used to be up there,
but I'm here.

527
00:36:08,996 --> 00:36:11,130
Harry,
there's nothing average about you.

528
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,532
You have seven PHDs.

529
00:36:12,533 --> 00:36:14,961
Well, not anymore.

530
00:36:16,414 --> 00:36:18,171
- I was supposed to fix this.
- What's the matter?

531
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:19,505
- And you did, Ramon.
- I didn't...

532
00:36:19,506 --> 00:36:21,508
Ramon, you did. You did.

533
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:25,561
You brought me back. You
brought back what matters.

534
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,637
So what if I'm... look, my whole life,

535
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:29,758
I've been defined by one thing...

536
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:36,875
my IQ... and somehow you've given me...

537
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:39,117
a balance...

538
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:44,595
between my head and...

539
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:55,475
Thank you for the balance, Ramon.

540
00:36:57,742 --> 00:37:01,344
Now I'm going to take
that balance to my Earth.

541
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:03,064
- Huh?
- Wait, Harry.

542
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:06,318
Harry, we just... we just got you back.

543
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,130
No, I know, Iris.

544
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,275
I have to go see my daughter.

545
00:37:12,284 --> 00:37:15,185
I mean, I might not have
the intelligence to garner

546
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:19,755
seven PHDs, but I can
see one thing clearly.

547
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:21,555
Family matters.

548
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:26,434
Well, we're family too.

549
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:29,479
Heck yeah, you are.

550
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:32,323
Each and every one of you.

551
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,835
I'll miss you.

552
00:37:36,451 --> 00:37:38,053
- Okay.
- Well...

553
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:44,697
I don't know.

554
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,835
- We should probably hug.
- I was like...

555
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,096
Yeah.

556
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:53,333
I'll miss you.

557
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:55,902
- Love you guys.
- Love you too.

558
00:37:55,903 --> 00:37:57,471
I love you too.

559
00:38:00,507 --> 00:38:03,547
There could be a million
Harrys in this multiverse,

560
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:05,150
but you...

561
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,614
are one of a kind.

562
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:15,653
I love you too.

563
00:38:22,874 --> 00:38:25,009
It's the end of an era.

564
00:38:37,154 --> 00:38:38,557
- Hi.
- There she is.

565
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,457
Hi.

566
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:42,748
Oh, man.

567
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:43,736
Ohh.

568
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:46,220
Hi.

569
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,588
Joe, she's beautiful.

570
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:50,213
Just like her mother.

571
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:53,041
I think this calls for a toast.

572
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:59,180
I said, this calls for a toast.

573
00:38:59,189 --> 00:39:01,824
- Sorry, I was...
- I got it, I got it.

574
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:02,605
Wally!

575
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:05,678
You didn't think I'd miss my new
baby sister's first party, right?

576
00:39:08,756 --> 00:39:10,055
All right,

577
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:13,134
to the newest member of Team Flash.

578
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:16,211
Jenna Marie West.

579
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,655
Welcome to the family.

580
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:20,065
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

581
00:39:24,716 --> 00:39:28,453
Nice party.
It's so good to see everyone.

582
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:30,930
You know, I heard that the Legends

583
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:32,172
have quite some parties too.

584
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:35,714
So, tell me,

585
00:39:35,723 --> 00:39:37,932
did you find what you were looking for?

586
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:41,025
Yeah, I did. And a lot more.

587
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,302
I think fighting a time-demon helped.

588
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:47,206
But, Dad, look, I left
Team Flash cause I felt

589
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:49,749
like I was always gonna
be in Barry's shadow.

590
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:53,060
But as a Legend, I...

591
00:39:53,069 --> 00:39:56,266
I learned how to be
comfortable just being me.

592
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:58,724
I'm so proud of you, son.

593
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:00,368
Thank you.

594
00:40:00,377 --> 00:40:02,946
- Let's see your sister.
- Yes.

595
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,278
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.

596
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,719
Oh, you know Harry was right.

597
00:40:09,369 --> 00:40:11,703
This is really all that matters.

598
00:40:13,336 --> 00:40:15,141
We're next, you know?

599
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,680
Wait, what do you mean?

600
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:19,123
You want to have a baby now?

601
00:40:19,202 --> 00:40:20,703
What do you mean? Right now?

602
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:21,712
- Barry.
- What?

603
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,222
- Relax.
- I'm fine. I just...

604
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:25,337
Are you? I just meant someday.

605
00:40:25,346 --> 00:40:26,041
Yeah.

606
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,217
Not anytime in the near future.

607
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:29,954
- Right.
- Oh my God.

608
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:33,099
Let me just get you a
refill so you can relax.

609
00:40:33,108 --> 00:40:34,977
That's nice. Thanks.

610
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,903
- Hi.
- Hey.

611
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:46,149
- We need to talk.
- What?

612
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:48,196
Wow, this house is bitchin'.

613
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:52,586
I think I've seen you before.

614
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:54,597
Didn't you spill coffee
all over Harry and me?

615
00:40:55,074 --> 00:40:58,275
Yeah, did she pay for yours?
Because she paid for ours.

616
00:40:58,284 --> 00:40:59,952
Weren't you the server at their wedding?

617
00:40:59,953 --> 00:41:01,829
Wait, yeah, you were.

618
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:04,605
And where did you get this jacket?

619
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:11,096
From her.

620
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:17,579
No, mine... mine is one of a kind.

621
00:41:18,038 --> 00:41:22,174
So was this... when
you let me borrow it.

622
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,673
Who are you?

623
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,987
I'm your daughter, Nora.

624
00:41:29,113 --> 00:41:30,893
From the future.

625
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:33,207
And I think I...

626
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:37,183
made a big, big, mistake.

626
00:41:38,305 --> 00:41:44,319
